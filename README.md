## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smamanoor79-stack/doctor-appointment-project.git
cd <doctor-appointment-project>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` — it's already excluded via `.gitignore`.

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the public site, and [http://localhost:3000/admin/login](http://localhost:3000/admin/login) for the admin dashboard.
